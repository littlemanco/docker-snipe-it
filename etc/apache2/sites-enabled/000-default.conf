# This deliberately does not support HTTPS. It's designed to be a minimal working container; should something like
# HTTPS be required, please use the configuration management tooling implemented by your orchestrator. For example,
# a Kubernetes configuration map.
#
# Todo: Write an example HTTPS host here. Also, it might be possible to support it with the snakeoil cert.
